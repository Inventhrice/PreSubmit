## Pre-Submit
Pre-Submit is an application developed to help students ensure that they are handing everything in correctly for an assignment. This application is still in development!

UPDATE: Version 1 is out! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³


### Description
Pre-Submit is an application that allows students to upload assignment files to make sure that they are not missing anything that can lose them marks. This idea was born when we realized that students do lose marks due to not reading the instructions carefully, which can be an honest mistake. Currently, the application can only verify if a file exists in your submission or not, and more features will be added in a future iteration!

### License
Unfortunately, this project is not yet open source. I would love to make it so, however due to extenuating circumstances, I cannot. Thank you for understanding.
